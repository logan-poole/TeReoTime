            <h2>1. About this Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy explains how Te Reo Time handles information when you use the app and visit any
                related
                webpages. It is written in plain language so whānau, schools, and tamariki can easily understand it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This policy is intended to align with the principles of the <strong>New Zealand Privacy Act
                    2020</strong> and

            <h2>2. Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                Te Reo Time was developed by <strong>Logan Poole</strong> in Aotearoa New Zealand as a passion project
                to
                support te reo Māori in everyday life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Logan comes from Rotorua and is of <strong>Ngāi Tūhoe, Tainui and Te Arawa</strong> descent, doing his
                best to
                support his culture in modern ways through technology and education.
            </p>
            <p>
                For any privacy or legal questions, you can contact:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Email:</strong> hconmem@gmail.com</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- 3. What information we do NOT collect -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>3. Information We <em>Do Not</em> Collect</h2>
            <p>
                When you use the Te Reo Time app, we do <strong>not</strong> ask you to provide:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or postal addresses</li>
                <li>Payment or credit card information</li>
                <li>Profile photos or personal media uploads</li>
                <li>Contact lists or social media data</li>
                <li>Precise GPS location</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The app is designed to run locally on your device. Any learning progress or settings are stored on the
                device
                itself and are not sent to a central server controlled by Te Reo Time.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 4. Information that may be processed automatically -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>4. Information That May Be Processed Automatically</h2>
            <p>
                While Te Reo Time itself does not actively collect personal information, some technical data may be
                processed by
                third parties as part of normal app and website operation.
            </p>

            <h3>4.1. App Stores & Platform Providers</h3>
            <p>
                If you download Te Reo Time from an app store (for example Google Play or another store), that store may
                collect information such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which country you downloaded the app from</li>
                <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
                <li>Basic install and crash statistics</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This information is handled under the privacy policy of the app store provider (for example Google’s
                privacy
                policy). Te Reo Time only sees anonymised, aggregated statistics (for example total installs, crashes),
                not
                named individual user data.
            </p>

            <h3>4.2. Crash Reports & Diagnostics</h3>
            <p>
                Your device or app store may generate anonymous crash logs or error reports if the app stops working.
                These can
                help improve stability and remove bugs. They typically contain:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anonymous device information (model, OS version)</li>
                <li>Which screen or part of the app crashed</li>
                <li>Technical error messages</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Te Reo Time does not use this information to identify individual users.
            </p>

            <h3>4.3. Local Settings on Your Device</h3>
            <p>
                The app may store basic preferences directly on your device, for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your preferred language or display mode</li>
                <li>Which learning sections you’ve favourited</li>
                <li>App settings such as sound or notification preferences</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These settings stay on your device only and are deleted if you uninstall the app or clear its data.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 5. Website, cookies & analytics -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>5. Website, Cookies & Analytics</h2>
            <p>
                If you visit the Te Reo Time website or resources pages (for example an information site or
                documentation
                page), your web browser will automatically send some standard information, such as your IP address and
                browser
                type.
            </p>

            <h3>5.1. Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                At present, the Te Reo Time site:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Does not use</strong> tracking cookies for advertising.</li>
                <li>May use basic cookies or local storage for things like remembering your theme (light/dark) or simple
                    preferences.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.2. Analytics</h3>
            <p>
                If simple analytics tools (for example privacy-friendly page view counters) are used, they are used only
                to
                understand:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How many people are visiting the site</li>
                <li>Which pages are most useful</li>
                <li>Which devices and browsers are being used (so the site can be improved)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These analytics are not used to build individual profiles and are not shared or sold. If more advanced
                analytics are added in the future, this section will be updated to explain exactly what is used and why.

            <h2>7. How Any Information Is Used</h2>
            <p>
                Where any information is processed (for example anonymous usage data from an app store), it is used only
                to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monitor basic stability and performance of the app</li>
                <li>Identify bugs and crashes that need fixing</li>
                <li>Understand which features are most useful so they can be improved</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

            <p>
                Under the principles of the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, if Te Reo Time ever holds personal information
                about
                you, you have the right to:
            </p>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using reputable app stores and hosting providers</li>

            <p>
                No system can be 100% secure, but the aim is to reduce risk by collecting as little information as
